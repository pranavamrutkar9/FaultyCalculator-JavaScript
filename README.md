# Faulty Calculator 🧮❌

A fun and quirky calculator built using JavaScript that **intentionally performs incorrect operations 10% of the time**! This project simulates a faulty calculator for learning purposes and demonstrates how randomness and conditional logic work in JavaScript. Great for learning conditional logic, randomness, and function expressions in JavaScript.

## 🔧 Features

- Takes two numbers as input from the user.
- Performs one of the four basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- Has a 10% chance of performing a **wrong operation**:
  - `+` → `-`
  - `-` → `/`
  - `*` → `+`
  - `/` → `*`

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` — Basic HTML file that loads the calculator script.
- `script.js` — JavaScript logic for performing correct or faulty calculations based on probability.
